# Business Problem
What makes a successful movie? Can we use publicly-available data from past movies to predict the success of future
ones? To make recommendations to increase the success of future movies?

# Tasks
1. Generate a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset
2. Analyze Movie data for trends
3. Main Question: What makes a successful movie?
4. Generate a model to predict movie success

# Data Sources:
